Arts Equity Index Average Explainer
==========================

#Elementary School 

##Average
We want to know what the average school in LAUSD looks like with regards to arts education. We have two relevant categories: the percent of kids eligible for free/reduced meals (frpm) and the percent of kids receiving arts instruction. I found an average for each and found 14 schools that fit both. 
##Arts Education
LAUSD uses five categories when describing the number of students receiving arts education. When the school administrators filled out the survey, they could select from the following (in parentheses is the number of schools in that category):
*No students receive an arts education (8 schools)
*1-25% of students receive an arts education (80 schools)
*26-50% of students receive an arts education (105 schools)
*51-75% of students receive an arts education (84 schools)
*76-100% of students receive an arts education (155 schools)
I used the highly scientific method of choosing the category in between the two largest. 
##Percent eligible for frpm
The average percentage is 75.9%, so I decided to grab all schools from 70-79% eligible for good measure. 

##Outliers 
In looking for outliers in the numbers, I went through all 5 categories of 'amount of arts education', and I looked at the school with the lowest and highest of percentage of students eligible for frpm. This allows us to see how schools with different class-populations are able to serve their student populations in the same way.
