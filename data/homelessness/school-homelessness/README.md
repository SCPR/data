# Youth Homelessness Data
The McKiney-Vento Act requires schools to collect data on youth homelessness. KPCC began collecting such data from districts and is making that available here.

We're sharing the data both as it was [originally received](./files_as_provided/) and in a format [more friendly for analysis](./csv_files/).
