#What county is this city in??

Perhaps you have wondered this. Or been confronted a long, structured list of California cities. You'd like to know what county they're in, but don't really need to geolocate them.

Thankfully, the California Department of Finance [has such a list](http://www.dof.ca.gov/html/fs_data/stat-abs/tables/city_county_list10-03.pdf), which we have converted to csv for your joining needs. Note that the data is from 2003.
