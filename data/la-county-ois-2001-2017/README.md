#What's here

[**yearly-police-shootings-la-county.csv**](/yearly-police-shootings-la-county.csv): A yearly breakdown of the number of police shootings in Los Angeles County, from 2001 through 2017. The data was received by KPCC from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in January, 2018. It is a csv file.

Since the DA sends investigators to the site of any "hit" police shooting in the County, and subsequently investigates and determines the criminality of shootings, this is a full count of hit shootings by on and off duty officers in LA County.

The csv file also includes data on in-custody deaths, which the DA also investigates.

The DA does not include data about the specific circumstances of shootings, but now [publishes its reviews online](http://da.lacounty.gov/reports/ois). KPCC built a database of police shootings in LA County in 2015 and posted data on more than 350 incidents [here](https://github.com/SCPR/kpcc-data-team/tree/master/data/kpcc-officer-involved).

This repo also includes an svg for use in KPCC's story on these numbers; it's also available [here](http://projects.scpr.org/infographics/misc-svg/Police_shootings_in_Los_Angeles_County_by_year_jsid_ois_count_chartbuilder.svg).
