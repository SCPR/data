#Water district shapefiles in California
In its fourth year of drought, California began imposing mandatory cutbacks on hundreds of urban water suppliers across thes state. In 2016, the state allowed suppliers to set their own reduction targets. Many set those targets at zero.

Nevertheless, the State Water Resources Control Board [reports continues to report their water use each month](http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/conservation_portal/conservation_reporting.shtml)

Exactly *where* are those districts, and what are their service areas? What geographic patterns can we discern in water use?

These are surprisingly difficult questions to answer. **There is no central repository of water district shapefiles** in the state.

The GIS data here was compiled by the Department of Water Resources. DWR spokeswoman Lauren Bisnett told KPCC that "it comes from a wide range of sources of a wide range of qualities. There isnâ€™t a better water agency dataset in existence to our knowledge, but ours should be considered a rough." 

It is indeed rough, with many overlapping service areas (there should be none since service areas don't overlap), and adjoining districts that fit together like jagged puzzle pieces (see Los Angeles and San Fernando).

#What's here
KPCC was able to match more than 380 of the districts in the monthly urban water use reports to the DWR data.

The [urban_water_districts.geojson file](/urban_water_districts.geojson) is those districts, along with their name as represented each month in the SWRCB. This allows a user to join the shapefiles to the water use data.

The attribute table also includes all the fields provided by the DWR.

You can see the full extent of the DWR water district boundaries [on their website](https://gis.water.ca.gov/app/boundaries/).
