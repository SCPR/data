# California Lottery Data

In June 2018, KPCC/LAist published [a story on the California Lottery](http://laist.com/2018/06/19/lottery.php).

The story analyzed billions of dollars in lottery sales, finding that:

* Ticket sales are disproportionately high in the poorest quarter of census tracts in nearly every populous county.
* Ticket sales are disproportionately high in Southern California census tracts with a plurality of Asian-Americans or Latinos.
* Ticket sales are disproportionately high in the Southern California counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.

We are publishing **monthly lottery sales by retailer, from 2010 through January 2018**, data that was used to report the story. The dataset reflects more than $42 billion in lottery sales across California, at more than 36,000 retailers.

That dataset is in this repo as *monthly-lottery-sales-2010-to-jan-2018.csv.zip* (the csv is too large to post here). Once unzipped, it includes all the fields provided by the California Lottery in response to KPCC's records request, as well as the total monthly sales by store (the sum of draw and scratcher sales) and the date on the first of the month, to facilitate analysis.

KPCC's analysis focused on sales in 2016 and 2017, and we geocoded the retailers active during those two years. Because no one should ever have to geocode these 25,460 retailers ever again, we are publishing that here as *stores_geocoded.csv*.

It is this data that KPCC used to perform our analysis of lottery sales by census tract.
