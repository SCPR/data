#LASD shootings data
After a KPCC CPRA seeking an updated version of Los Angeles Sheriff's Department data on deputy-involved shootings, a page featuring that data in PDF form was removed from the department's website.

While [some of the data is posted to LA County's portal](https://data.lacounty.gov/Criminal/Deputy-Details-Hit-Shooting-Incidents-and-Non-Hit-/7jc3-gsk7) it lacks fields such as if the deputy's force and tactics were found to be in policy, and if the deputy was disciplined. That information (which the LAPD makes public, though not in a strucutred format) is an important public look into the police shootings, [which can often be opaque](http://projects.scpr.org/officer-involved/stories/the-black-box/).

#What's here
KPCC pulled down all the PDFs linked to on the page on June 3, when they were still available. Those are in the [lasd_public_data_page_pdfs](./lasd_public_data_page_pdfs) folder. It includes PDFs posted by the department on hit, non-hit, animal, warning shot and unintentional discharge incidents.

KPCC's Chris Keller had previously converted some of the PDFs to csv files, which are available in the [csv folder](./csv/). Those are available for for the hit shootings data on deputies, suspects and incidents. Much of the other data is available (and more recent) on the County data portal.
