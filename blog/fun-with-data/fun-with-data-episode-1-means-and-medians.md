Good afternoon…

I've been looking through data for settlements approved by the L.A. City Council and realized there are some lessons that apply to any dataset our newsroom might find. Specifically, in pretty much any dataset we can find three types of stories:

* How did things change over time? Did they increase? Did they stay the same? Did they decrease?
* What is normal? What has history shown us to be the usual?
* What are the extreme instances? For instance the $15 million settlement and a $16 million settlement in FY 15-16 are extreme.
* In order to answer these questions, we're often going to have to come face to face with two little words we've all confronted at some point: average (aka mean) and median.

We see these terms used in studies. Our sources use them in a sentence, and sometimes appropriately. We've might have used them interchangeably. But what can they tell us, and when should you use one over the other?

**Averages**

Here are the annual average settlement amounts approved by the LA City Council over the last 11 years for cases that involved the Los Angeles Police Department. These are from things like traffic accidents, use of force cases and civil rights violations.

|year | average|
|---------|:-------------:|
|2005-2006 | $562,513.37|
|2006-2007 | $593,292.08|
|2007-2008 | $297,369.64|
|2008-2009 | $558,504.17|
|2009-2010 | $1,153,021.08|
|2010-2011 | $753,134.21|
|2011-2012 | $724,244.92|
|2012-2013 | $1,582,662.24|
|2013-2014 | $1,134,499.28|
|2014-2015 | $1,403,270.58|
|2015-2016 | $2,074,619.84|

**WHOA**: Look at the increase in the average between FY 11-12 and FY 12-13. And then again between FY 14-15 and FY 15-16. Never mind that outlier in the middle of the dataset when approved settlements jumped more by an average of more than $1 million.

**LESSON**: The average is our "best possible guess" for what to expect in the future. It's all of the values added up and then divided by the total number of values. A colleague put it this way: "Sum up all of the rainy days in your area for as many years as you have data for, divide by the amount of years, and that's your best bet for how much rain to expect this year."

**Medians**

Now let's consider the median…

|year | median|
|---------|:-------------:|
|2005-2006 | $200,000.00|
|2005-2006 | $450,000.00|
|2005-2006 | $192,410.00|
|2005-2006 | $259,982.00|
|2005-2006 | $250,000.00|
|2005-2006 | $362,500.00|
|2005-2006 | $450,000.00|
|2005-2006 | $484,416.00|
|2005-2006 | $500,000.00|
|2005-2006 | $843,780.00|
|2005-2006 | $786,000.00|

**WHOA**: That huge increase we saw between FY 11-12 and FY 12-13 isn't quite so large? And the data between FY 14-15 and FY 15-16 now actually shows a decrease. But now there's a super large increase between FY 13-14 and FY 14-15. What is going on?

**LESSON**: Remember how we said the average can be thought of as an expected value. Well the median can be thought of as a typical value. It's where half of the values in a range are lower and half of the values are higher.

**Takeaways**

We can often find these stark differences between the average and the median when working with datasets such as home prices or salaries – really any data where values at the extreme ends of the range can push an average up or pull it down.

Given the data above, I think the median is a more accurate way to describe this data to an audience. It's a better indicator of the typical values found in the data. And I would do my best to explain out the increases.

To do that you really need to see the raw data - which is something I'd want to see if an agency only provided me with the figures above. When looking at the raw data I find the city council approved a $15 million settlement and a $16 million settlement that push the FY 15-16 average up.

By now some of you might be saying "AGGGGGHHHHHH. What is happening. I hate data." I hope some of you are saying "oh, that's interesting. I see how this applies to my work."

**Some thoughts on that**:

* If an agency only provided you figures for the average or for the median, ask to see the other.
* Ask an agency to see the raw data. A line by line analysis might provide some insight into increases or decreases over time.
* Again, there are three types of stories you can find in any dataset:
    * How did things change over time? Did they increase? Did they stay the same? Did they decrease?
    * What is normal? What has history shown us to be the usual?
    * What are the extreme instances? For instance the $15 million settlement and a $16 million settlement in FY 15-16 are extreme.

So with this knowledge now under your belt, what do you see in the data? What is striking? What mistakes or assumptions am I making in my quick analysis? Or are you more confused than ever and nothing makes sense? Swing on by and chat.
