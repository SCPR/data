On last week's episode we talked about data for settlements approved by the L.A. City Council. As a result we received one fantastic question from one of our esteemed colleagues:

**EC**: Why do you think median payouts are trending upwards?    
**ME**: Good point: should have included. Higher settlement amounts overall…    
**EC**: Yeah, but why? One could conclude that the police are more brutal. Or that they are simply facing more litigation. Or that a law change is bolstering plaintiff cases. What does it tell us about law or law enforcement?    

The question is a good one. It's pointing out the core requirement of any story – whether it's based on data or not and that's the why. Or to borrow another's phrase: "So What?"

Properly interviewed data can tell us many things. It can give us some of all of the what and when and the who and where. But the why and the how…?

We need to talk to people who can help provide insight and additional questions we can ask. We need to pick up a shovel and dig. We need to do reporting.

When we talk about data too often we think of numbers in a spreadsheet. But all information we encounter is data. It just isn't necessarily "structured data."

How can narrative text be turned into structured data? How can public speeches or documents be turned into structured data? By finding repeating elements and common attributes.

If you use our Slack account – which you should be doing by the way, especially if you have ever complained about "conversational email" – in the data team channel you can now find "Trump's Executive Orders Bot"

It's a computer program – written before USA Today dropped today's news about the differences between executive orders posted to whitehouse.gov and those posted to the federal register – that scans a webpage every couple of hours for new information. When it finds something new it posts a message to slack. Below is what it looked like the first time it ran.



We can also structure the public speeches or announcements that our officials make right? If I was covering a public official or someone making public statements about an issue I might want to track change over time – one of the three stories we can find in data.

So to do that I might keep track of the following:

* time
* date
* location of comments
* who said it
* what they said
* audience
* topic
* links to account or source
* last time I updated this information

After a few months of keeping track I might have a handful of threads I can begin to look into.

Have an idea for a bot that would inform your reporting? Want some assistance in setting up a spreadsheet to give structure to unstructured data on your beat?  Swing on by and chat.
