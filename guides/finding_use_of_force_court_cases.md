LA County Use of Force
======================
This is going to be an attempt to chronicle how I tracked down the details of different crimes committed by police officers in LA County, but hopefully will serve as an illustrative example for others that want to wrangle information out of the court system. Sometimes the charge sheet doesn't give enough information for a news story, so some more leg work is involved. 

### What we were looking for 
The goal of looking through officer use of force cases was to find the narrative details of the case. We wanted to know what the officers did to be charged with use of force. Specifically, we wanted to see cases where officers had been charged of using excessive force only while patrolling. 

## What we were given 
In the process of the OIS project, we had two sets of information relating to officers and use of force in LA County. The first is a large number of declination memos, and the second is a spreadsheet of officers who unlawfully touched another person. 

The declination memo will have lots of narrative information but is only available when the DA chooses not to prosecute. It has a complete story of what led up to a potential crime, but is only available some cases. 

The spreadsheet of officers who unlawfully touched another person was given to us by the DA after Chris submitted a CPRA request for "names, badge numbers, and case numbers" relating to filed on duty and off-duty use of force cases filed with the DA's office. The spreadsheet the DA provided only has case number, case name, and the charges. The DA doesn't make a distinction between on-duty and off-duty incidents, so it included both on-duty officers, sheriffs deputies in charge of county jails, and off-duty officers. 

## Filtering the data
Since the info the DA provided didn't match what we wanted to know, we had to desperate the relevant cases from the rest. 

The [LA Superior Court](http://www.lacourt.org/) has an online database of cases filed in LA County. Not all the cases are free to view, but the website does have summaries of criminal cases, which provide basically the same information that the DA provided us, plus some other information like dates and dispositions. The first thing I did was to go through and verify all the information that the DA provided us, checking against the criminal case summary online. It became apparent while doing this that the info the DA gave us was slightly inaccurate. Sometimes the charges online didn't match the charges the DA gave us, or the case number didn't match the name provided. Our spreadsheet, titled LA County Use of Force Reports, has a column for marking differences in the spreadsheet provided and the online database.

Once the info was verified, we had to figure out what the officers were charged with. [The California Legislative Info website](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes.xhtml) has the complete law, searchable by number. Our spreadsheet has the charges that the officers faced and a brief description. After cataloging every charge and disposition, we labeled the whether the case involved excessive force on duty and whether it was relevant. 

In addition to adding information on the charges, we also cataloged the officer's pleas and the disposition. Pleas were either guilty, innocent, or nolo contendere (no contest) and the dispositions were either guilty/convicted, dismissed, or dismissed per 1203.4 P.C. (which means convicted and later expunged).

After cataloging all of the charges, there were 24 relevant cases in the data. Relevant here means that the case involved a potentially on-duty officer that had unlawfully used force against a person, weeding out cases of domestic abuse and sexual assault. 

## Finding Narrative Information 
The information provided by the DA and the LA Court database isn't enough to find out what exactly happened in the cases. We needed to narrow down much further. There are a few problems with only looking at the court's online database and charge sheet. Most of all, LA County jails are run by the sheriff's department, but jail brutality is an entirely different issue and outside the purview of our investigation. We need to know whether the case involved an officer, on duty and routine patrol, used excessive force. 

The first route to finding narrative information on the cases I took was to go to the courthouse and look up the cases. Criminal cases are public records and open to viewing. The case does not always have the information you need, but its the first place to look. Clerks at the different courthouses have the right to go through the files and pull things that they believe to not be subject to public records. How much they are allowed to pull/redact is unclear, so fight back when they may be pulling way too much. 

On that note, find people who can advocate for you. They will be your friend. Reach out to public information officers in different parts of the civic structure.They can help you when the courts get apprehensive about following public information laws. 

There are many different places that the criminal case might be:
* Archives and halls of records. In Los Angeles, its the Hall of Records located at 320 W. Temple St. Ideally, all the cases would be at the hall of records, but in LA, files are on about a 7 year delay in being moved from various courthouse offices to the hall of records. You can request files all day, but they will only give you three at a time to view. 

* Courthouses where the cases were filed. The Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center at 210 W. Temple St. had a majority of the files I needed to see. The clerks at the Justice Center said that I was only allowed to view 3 files a day, and that I wasn't allowed to request any more. I heard different excuses for why, and I believe that it came down to there being a very small staff handling all requests for cases. I had 19 cases I needed to see, and waiting that long wasn't reasonable so I worked with Evelyn and Mary Hearn, the Public Information Officer for the Superior Court of LA to get the files faster.

* City Attorney's Office. Not all the cases were filed with the District Attorney's Office. I worked with the public information officer there, Frank Mateljan, and he tracked down some information that I needed. 

* Newspapers. For some of the cases, the only narrative information I could come across was in the LA Times. 

These did not get me all the info that I needed. Many of the files were missing narrative details related to the crime. I was able to find out that Officer X violated Penal Code ### when he assaulted Victim A, but not the circumstances under which the assault occurred. The amount of information I received when viewing the file was wildly different case to case. In one instance, I was only given three pages, and in others, I received the entire testimony. I do not know the reasons for the information disparity. 


##Conversation with Dave Maas on how to find more info on cops
I spoke with journalist [Dave Maas](http://maassive.com/) about how to find details on the criminal cases. Here is a short list of all the things he suggested we try.

# District Attorney's Office
The two best documents we can get from the DAs office are the charge evaluation worksheet and the declination memorandum. The charge evaluation worksheet details what the defendant was charged with, so a list of the penal/vehicle/health etc. code violations, but won't have a lot of details. 

The declination memo will have lots of narrative information but is only available when the DA chooses not to prosecute. It has a complete story of what led up to a potential crime, but is only available some cases. A declination memo literally means a memo detailing why the DA is declining to prosecute.

# Police Oversight Board
The Police Oversight Board tracks complaints about officers. You can track down the complaints leveled against the officers 

# Civil Service Commission 
They conduct their own mini-trials when it comes to the civil cases filed against police. You may be able to find the reports on those hearings 

# Civil Suits
Investigate the civil case repository of the LA superior court to see if the officers have had civil cases filed against them related to their use of force 

# Lawyers
There tends to be a small number of lawyers that go after bad cops in any given city. Dave said that they tend to keep their own list of crooked cops and suggested that I call some lawyers and talk to them to see what they would be willing to share

# Justia.com
Look through justia.com to find more filings against the officers or the police department. Filter by civil rights cases.
