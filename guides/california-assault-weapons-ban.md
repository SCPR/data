1989 California Assault Weapons Ban
===================================

###Boilerplate on 1989 law

* **The law**: The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989 became law on January 1, 1990. [Per the LAT](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-19/news/mn-112_1_assault-weapons-ban-military-style-assault-types-of-semiautomatic-rifles/2), it established a new classification of firearms: assault weapons. They're outlawed, unless you have a special permit (or already owned one).

* **Legal challenges**: Kasler v. Lockyer found in favor of the state over the assault weapons ban, in 1999. A 2001 decision—Harrott v. Kings County—altered that decision slightly, requiring the DOJ to determine which specific makes and models of AR and AK weapons are prohibited.

* **Loophole**: Bullet buttons can render the law basically useless. As described by [the Daily Beast](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/08/blame-governor-moonbeam-for-syed-farook-s-guns.html): "a rifle is not an assault weapon if it has a fixed as opposed to a detachable magazine. A fixed magazine is defined as one that cannot be removed without either dissembling the weapon’s working parts or employing a tool. But gun manufacturers quickly came up with a button that released a magazine by pushing it with the tip of a bullet, which was deemed a non-tool."

* **Background**:In January 1989, a school shooting in Stockton killed five and injured 29 others, [leading to California's first-in-the-nation ban on assault weapons](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/1989-calif-school-shooting-led-to-assault-weapons-ban/). Two Los Angeles politicians, Assemblyman Mike Roos and Senate leader David A. Roberti, were behind that bill. [Roos asserted that](http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-19/news/mn-112_1_assault-weapons-ban-military-style-assault-types-of-semiautomatic-rifles/2) opposition to his bill was the "last gasp of the NRA."
