## Visualizing information

Charts can be an effective and engaging way of displaying quantitative information. They can also be [total garbage](http://viz.wtf/). How can we make sure our charts fall on the right side of [the thin line between clever and stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtXkD1BC564)?

Below are general guidelines, along with tools we use and use cases for those tools. Parts of this borrow generously from [an excellent styleguide](https://github.com/SCPR/scpr-styleguide) put together by the KPCC Product Team (it's a Middleman site; to set it up, you can follow [the instructions laid out here](https://github.com/SCPR/scpr-longreads)).

## General charting guidelines
#### Colors 

KPCC Orange is our hero color. Its primary role is to signify the brand in all our visual representations. It's a strong color, and should be used sparingly. Good use cases include logo treatments and design elements responsible for communicating KPCC's brand (app icons, website mastheads, product titling).

KPCC Orange: #F87E21

##### Accent Colors 

KPCC's accent colors support our brand color. They are vibrant, chosen to invoke the feel of Southern California. Like our brand color, these should also be used judiciously.

KPCC Deep Orange: #D15904
KPCC Blue: #31ABD4
KPCC Deep Blue: #007397
KPCC Dark Blue: #0F1620

#### Neutral Colors 

KPCC has two sets of neutral colors - warm and cool. Cool neutrals should be used for contexts that call for more austerity and formality - especially useful in editorial contexts. The warm neutrals are best for situations where we need to convey greater intimacy, personality and emotional connection. 

##### Warm Neutrals

Near White: #EDF2F4; Light Gray: #DEE4E5; Medium Gray: #B5BEC0; Deep Gray: #6C7579; Dark Gray: #222628

##### Cool Neutrals

## General principles
- Collaborate on reporting, stories or projects with reporters.
- Offer advice on how to request records and data, find and clean datasets and check findings.
- Brainstorm how to present findings and data whether in a narrative or visual form.
- Recommend data to use to make apples-to-apples comparisons, data sources to shy away from and how to understand limitations.
- Request records and data, find and clean datasets and check findings when required.
- Offer insight about the things that don't lead to stories and how we do work.
- Ask "Who is our audience?", "What do they need?" and "What can we make?"
- [Humanize data](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/connecting-dots/)

## Chartbuilder
KPCC's [chartbuilder tool](http://projects.scpr.org/internal/tools/kpcc-chartbuilder/), adapted [from Quartz](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/), quickly makes four simple types of charts: line, column, bar grid and scatter.

**Advantages** 
- Easy  
- Fast
- HTML data tables

**Drawbacks** 
- Static images
- Limited color palette
- No interactivity

Use cases:
- Reporter at large: Many reporters and editors are already using Chartbuilder.
- Data team: Effective tool for many visualizations.

## R
The [open source programming language R](http://www.r-project.org/) can visualize large, complex datasets. It's something the KPCC data team uses internally in analyzing data.

Those visualizations can be adapted for publication. Packages like [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) can be used to get those images ready for primetime. We recently [featured R visualizations in a story](http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/02/18/49905/water-main-break-submerges-vehicles-in-hollywood/) for the first time.

Standards for our R visualizations are a work in progress. Those can be found here[TK--R standards], along with sample of R code for spitting out viz.

**Advantages** 
- Can adapt visualizations created during [EDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)
- Highly customizable

**Drawbacks** 
- Static images
- Legends are tricky
- Steep learning curve

Use cases:
- Data team: tool for complex, customized visualizations.


## Interactive charting
Some charts benefit from an interactive treatment, allowing users to dive deeper into the data and look up specific informaiton. Creating a one-off for every project isn't possible, but some of those one-offs can become models that we can plug new data into for new stories.

There are myriad options out there for creative interactive charts.

Advantages and disadvantages are highly case-specific to the chart and code behind it. The Chartist javascript library is broken down below.

###Chartist

We have recently used [the Chartist javascript library](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/) to create a [line graph](http://projects.scpr.org/charts/metro-on-time-performance/rail-performance/) and a [bar chart](http://projects.scpr.org/applications/monthly-water-use/).

If/as the the Chartist library develops, it may make sense to create a tool that would allow the web team to plug in data and create responsive charts.

**Advantages** 
- Responsive
- Mobile-friendly
- Clean design
- Highly customizable
- Interactivity

**Drawbacks**
- Still being developed
- No built-in legends
- Coding knowledge a must

Use cases:
- Data team: Highly customizable charts
- Web team: Can use in future

## Maps/gifs/Data table

### Interactive maps

### Static maps/gifs
A couple recent stories have featured a static map (to indicate the radius that a study covered) and a gif (to display 10 different bus lines)

For both, I exported images from QGIS, using the Stamen Terrain layer as the background. I like that particular Stamen map as it does a nice job of indentifying cities and neighborhoods, which hopefully helps the user orient him/herself.
