#An approach to wrangling Cal-Access IE data

You can run this script in R Studio or your terminal, and it will spit out all 'independent expenditures' from 2016. Takes about 20 minutes.

All you need to do is cd into your current directory and run this

```
$ RScript ie_2016.r
```

You'll get a list of IEs on your desktop.

With some small changes, it can be updated for future elections. 

#Suggested analysis
Perhaps more helpfully, commented out at the bottom of the script are suggested ways to anaylze this data.
