Dare we say a "Statement of Purpose"
====================================

**["When deciding whether to commit to something, if I feel anything less than, 'Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!' - then my answer is no."](https://sivers.org/hellyeah)**

While not always an appropriate - or practical - attitude in a newsroom setting, the above-anecdote from Derek Sivers is an important one...

----

So what are common elements of successful projects?

----

Each Tuesday we've have a Muddle Huddle to consider the following:

* What did we accomplish last week? What worked? What didn't?
* What do we want to accomplish in the week ahead?
* What did we learn that we didn't know before?

We will share this information with the KPCC Regional Desk, Chris Knap, Paul Glickman, Stephen Gregory and the shows.

----

* What we're ready to do:
    * Collaborate on reporting, stories or projects with reporters.
    * Offer advice on how to request records and data, find and clean datasets and check findings.
    * Brainstorm how to present findings and data whether in a narrative or visual form.
    * Recommend data to use to make apples-to-apples comparisons, data sources to shy away from and how to understand limitations.
    * Request records and data, find and clean datasets and check findings when required.
    * Offer insight about the things that don't lead to stories and how we do work.
    * Ask "Who is our audience?", "What do they need?" and "What can we make?"

* What we shy away from:
    * A service desk where you drop off a spreadsheet and continue on your way.
    * The place where you go when you "want a map" for a story.
