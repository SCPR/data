What role does data reporting play at KPCC?
====================================

We bring data analysis, graphics, public records and traditional shoe leather reporting to KPCC's journalism â€” from long-term investigative projects to dailies. 

----

* What we're ready to do:
    * Report data-driven stories for KPCC's website and broadcast.
    * Collaborate on reporting, stories and projects with reporters.
    * Offer advice on how to request records and data, find and clean datasets and check findings.
    * Brainstorm how to present findings and data whether in a narrative and visual forms.
    * Recommend data to use to make apples-to-apples comparisons, data sources to shy away from and how to understand limitations.
    * Offer insight about our work.
    * Ask "Who is our audience?", "What do they need?" and "What can we make?"
    * Figure out how to build databases when what we need doesn't exist yet.
    * Share and create tools that make life easier for reporters and editors.

* What we shy away from:
    * Being a service desk where you drop off a spreadsheet and continue on your way.
    * The place where you go when you "want a map" for a story.
