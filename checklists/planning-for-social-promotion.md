Planning for social promotion
=============================

**Questions to ask**

* **Hashtag**: What's the name of the project? Will it work as a hashtag?
* **Stats**: What data is in the story? What top stats should be used as social promotion? If you don't know you might want to talk to Aaron or Chris sooner rather than later (CK).
* **GIF**: Can the data be visualized as a GIF?
* **Conversation/engagement**: Can we crowdsource ahead of time? What's the call to action once the story is published? This can be in the form of a photo, an experience, a question. Do we want our audience to search our database? Vote in a poll? Send us their questions? Tell us the price of their rent? Does it warrant a PIN query?
* **Pre-promotion**: How can we tease the project ahead of time? Can we release one element to create buzz?

**What social needs**

* **Visuals**: What do we want to highlight on Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook? Do we have photos? Do we have video? Should we stick with numbers? Quotes?
* **Quotes/stats**: These are especially important for social promotion. There should be a discussion with reporter/editor and social producer about top trends and anecdotes.
* **Script/audio**: We will cut the audio for Instagram and Twitter; we will use the script to identify sources, as well as sharable questions, quotes and stats.

**What social will do**

* **Media lists**: Create a Twitter list with sources, potentially interested orgs and stakeholders. Use that to also create a media list with email addresses and links to social pages.
* **Email outreach**: Draft a uniform email to send out to media list once story is published
* **Extra web elements**: Collect resources like http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips.htm for potential web FAQ
* **Social sound**: Cut great audio clips for Soundcloud and Speaking Photo
* **Social visuals**: Make sharable quote cards, which can be used as visuals for Insta, Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.
